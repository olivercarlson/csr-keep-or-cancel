# Keep or Cancel for the Chase Sapphire Reserve (CSR)

Version 2.0 is live as of 2/21/19, fully functional and deployed at: https://kocv2.herokuapp.com/

Version 1.0 of the site.

## ABOUT:

Many friends and family members ask me about whether or not it's worth keeping this card, I wrote this calculator to give them the most objective
advice possible. 

## WHY:

Boasting a cash sign up bonus in excess of $1,000, for most it was an easy choice of whether or not to sign up for the card **for the first year**

However, after the first year's sign up bonus, the questino of whether or not it was worthwhile to pay the whopping $450 became more difficult. 

Most of the advice I saw online fell into one of two oversimplified and generally unhelpful camps: (A) "the card is so good, the bank is paying you to use this card" or (B) "$450 is way too much to pay for a credit card, cancel it!"

Enter this guide.

## HOW:

This site is a step by step walkthrough aimed at helping people less fluent in the world of rewards credit cards to determine the value
proposition of the CSR from year 1 and beyond.

Each question has a corresponding drop down box which can provide guidance to those who want to see what each benefit is, as well as my
personal reccomendations if you don't know how to value them.

At the end, you will be taken to a page with a calculated result verdict. 

This verdict will compare the estimated output (based on your input) with a replacement level 2% cashback card to see if it is worthwhile
to continue holding onto the CSR and paying $450.

Additionally, if you choose to pair the CSR with another credit card (the Freedom Unlimited) and maximize your spending by switching between the two,
you can see the sum value returned by holding and using both cards. 


## Version Notes:

In version 2.0, many changes were made. Application is now fullstack with Node/Express and Mongo.

In the next update, ideally I will add either E2E testing via Cypress or possibly just unit tests w/ either Mocha/Chai or Jest.

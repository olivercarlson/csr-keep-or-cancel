# Keep or Cancel for the Chase Sapphire Reserve (CSR)

Version 2.0 is not yet deployed.

Version 1.0 of the site is currently deployed here: https://keeporcancel.netlify.com

## ABOUT:

Many friends and family members ask me about whether or not it's worth keeping this card, I wrote this calculator to give them the most objective
advice possible. 

This was written as my first website and deployed as a quick starter project to practice my web development skills.

## WHY:

On release, the CSR was an extremely successful product launch - so much so, that JPM Chase ran out of metal to make the card. 

Boasting a sign up bonus of more than $1,000 in value, for most it was an easy choice of whether or not to sign up for the card **for the first year**

However, after the first year's sign up bonus, it is very difficult to for many people to calculate whether or not they should continue paying
the whopping $450 annual fee. 

Enter this guide.

## HOW:

This site is a step by step walkthrough aimed at helping people less fluent in the world of rewards credit cards to determine the value
proposition of the CSR from year 1 and beyond.

Each question has a corresponding drop down box which can provide guidance to those who want to see what each benefit is, as well as my
personal reccomendations if you don't know how to value them.

At the end, you will be taken to a page with a calculated result verdict. 

This verdict will compare the estimated output (based on your input) with a replacement level 2% cashback card to see if it is worthwhile
to continue holding onto the CSR and paying $450.

Additionally, if you choose to pair the CSR with another credit card (the Freedom Unlimited) and maximize your spending by switching between the two,
you can see the sum value returned by holding and using both cards.
